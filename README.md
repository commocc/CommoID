# Commo ID, a multi-personality holder

This puzzle teaches us that absence of information can also be used as information.

## Problem

Citizens of countries with well-developed rights and freedoms usually benefit from following the law. They can rely on
the governmental institutions to protect their rights. Whilst in countries with poorly developed rights and freedoms the
laws themselves can be used to violate the rights of the citizens, and citizens have to rely on their own resources to
achieve their goals and protect their rights. In that countries citizens can form communities that implement the lacking
governmental institutions. But as government may recognize such communities as a threat to its power, it may continue to
tighten the laws thy making such communities harder to form and operate.

Every community usually consists of relatively public leaders and relatively private followers.

Leaders are well-known to followers and usually have more resources to protect themselves using their resources or
calling for the followers to donate or act on their behalf. On the other hand followers are usually more vulnerable to
attacks, because they are less known and have less resources to protect themselves.

It can lead to a situation when the followers refuse to join the community or act as part of the community, because they
are afraid of being attacked.

## Solution

Overall Commo Ecosystem is based on the idea of separation of people intentions and actions from their identity.
Intentions and actions are represented by communities and are considered to be public. But this public system doesn't
hold any information about the personalities themselves other then anonymous identifiers. This allows people to join
communities without revealing their identity. Of course, such an anonymous join will require of such people to proof
their value for the community, but this proof still can be made privately, e.g. we don't know who the person 1231443923
is, but we understand that he or she is valuable and we can trust her or him and provide him or her some resources.

Commo ID acts as a container for such anonymous identities. It is responsible for storing personal data following the
laws of a person's country of residence. But id hides information about how this person is represented in this or that
communities.

A person can have several identities in each communities that are stored in Commo ID in an encrypted form spread across
several vaults in relatively independent jurisdictions. And the person can choose which identity in which community may
be public and which is seen only by individually trusted members of the community.

Flexibility in having multiple identities in each community allows a person to define several levels of personal
security against different types of attacks. For example, a person can have a public identity in a community, but if he
or she is forced to reveal his or her private identity, a person can appear to have multiple identities and reveal the
one that is, yes, private, but is still safe to be revealed. At the same time a person can have other truly private
identities unrevealed and no one will be able to prove that this person has more identities unless the are trusted to
someone.

## Implementation

Commo ID is a tuple of opened contracts and a default implementation. You can choose to use the cloud, launch Commo ID on
premises or even use your own implementation of the holder.

If you procure any vulnerabilities in our approach or implementation, feel free to contact us. We give a value to people
freedom protection and appreciate any help in making our system more smart and secure.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why should I trust Commo ID?

You shouldn't. Commo ID is a tuple of opened contracts and a default software which can be replaced by any other
implementation. We are staying open to any criticism and suggestions.
